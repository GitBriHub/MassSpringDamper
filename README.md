# Mass Spring Damper System Simulation & Animation
This MATLAB project simulates and animates the dynamic behavior of a mass-spring-damper system using numerical integration. It models both the homogeneous (free) and inhomogeneous (forced) responses of the system over time, using the Runge-Kutta method for improved accuracy.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Simulate second-order differential equations representing mass-spring-damper motion.

- Analyze system response under varying mass, damping, and spring constants.

- Visualize both homogeneous and inhomogeneous motion in real time.

- Generate 10-second videos (30 FPS) showing system evolution for each trial.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Numerical solution via 4th-order Runge-Kutta method.

- Adjustable parameters for mass, damping, and spring stiffness.

- Clean side-by-side plot animations for comparison.

- Automatic video generation in .mp4 format.
